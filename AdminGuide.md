# 1 General Overview


## 1.1 Terminology 


-   **Series**: Ordered collection of multimedia objects.

-   **Multimedia Objects**: Set of media files (audio or video files), metadata and attachments (related files like ppts, pdfs, etc...). A multimedia object is composed of:
	
    - Several multimedia files: the "master" copy with maximum quality and one or several "distribution" or "delivery" copies, of the same media, encoded with different qualities or codecs.

    - Descriptive metadata, temporal and spatial-location metadata, presentation metadata and access-authorization metadata.

    - Subject area metadata.

    - Metadata about the people that takes part in the multimedia object production and their roles.

    - Attached files (PDF, PPT, etc...) and URLs that complete the content of the multimedia object.

-   **PuMuKIT (Back-Office):** The PuMuKIT back-office is a modular web application designed to manage the series and multimedia objects of a PuMuKIT video platform. Using this back-office you will be able to ingest, catalogue and publish your media (audio and video assets) to different channels: The internal Video Portal, iTunesU, YouTube, etc...

-   **Video-Portal (Web-TV):** The video focused, youtube-like, website generated by PuMuKIT.

-   **Metadata:**Editable information of a multimedia object (title, subtitle, keyword, copyright, genre, publish date, recording date, description).

-   **Modules:**Different sections of a PuMuKIT platform.

-   **Mono-stream content:** A multimedia object based on a single video or audio.

-   **Dual-stream content:** A multimedia object based on two videos, one for presenter and one for presentation. These videos are played simultaneously and they are usually stored in an opencast platform.

## 1.2 PuMuKIT Overview

PuMuKIT is a powerful Open-Source video platform, it provides great media cataloguing capabilities as well as the required flexibility needed to manage your media collections. PuMuKIT is specially designed for organizations with large collections of video and/or audio assets.

PuMuKIT can automate the publication process of your media through different online publishing channels such as Video-Portals (WebTV), different RSS feeds, iTunesU sites, YouTube channels or DSpace repositories.

# 2 Pumukit Software Management Tools

PuMuKIT"s back-office offers several tools to perform most of the GaliSERVER management tasks. In this section, the different management tools available will be explained.
For common media management tasks please check "PuMuKIT Content Manager Guide".

## 2.1 Admin users tool

Using this tool you can manage all users with access to PuMuKIT. Through this module, you can create, edit and delete users.
To access the "Admin users" tool click on "Management > Admin users".

![](images/list_users.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 2. Admin user module</font></div>

The permissions that a certain user is granted is managed through the Permission Profiles tool. A user can be assigned one of the default Permission Profiles, or a custom one created through the Permission Profiles Management Tool (See section 2.2 Permission Profiles).

### 2.1.1 How to create a new user

To create a new user, click on the "New" button on the bottom right corner of the screen. A new window will appear to fill the required fields for the new user to be created:

![](images/new_user_window.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 3. Create new user window</font></div>

The required fields for a user are listed below:
-   **Name and Surname**: This field will be the name that the user will have on the platform.
-   **Username**: This field will be the username required to log into PuMuKIT or the video portal.
-   **Password**: This field will be the password required to log into PuMuKIT or the video portal.
-   **Email**: This field will be the email associated with our user. This email is later used to link a certain user with the corresponding Person (See section 3.2.1 – People table)
-   **Permission Profile**: This field will be the „Permission Profile" set for this user. The user's Permission Profile will determine which sections and functionality can be accessed by this user.
Finally, click on "Save Changes" to create the user and save it to PuMuKIT.

### 2.1.2 Edit and delete users

The edit and the delete icons are located in the left side of the users table:

<p align="center"><img src="images/edit_delete_icons.png"></p>

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 4. Edit/delete icons</font></div>

Clicking on the edit icon will open a window similar to the "Create new user" window (view figure 3 – "Create new user window" above). Using this window you will be able to replace the values of the user's fields with new ones.
Clicking on the delete icon will permanently delete the user from PuMuKIT.

### 2.1.3 Filtering users

At the right side of the screen, there is a search filter that allows you to filter the users that are displayed at the users table.

<p align="center"><img src="images/admin_user_search.png"></p>

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 5. Admin User Search</font></div>

Users can be filtered by doing search on their username field, or by the Permission Profile assigned to them.

### 2.1.4 Executing an action on several users

Several users can be selected by clicking on their respective checkboxes at the left side of the users table.
If you click on the ‘Select an action...’ option, a pull-down list will be shown where you can select from several actions to carry out on the selected users:
-   **Delete selected**: This action will delete all the selected users.
-   **Promote to...**: This action will change the Permission Profile of all the selected users to the chosen one.

An example of this pull-down list is shown in the image below:

<p align="center"><img src="images/action_option.png"></p>

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 6. Select an action option</font></div>

## 2.2 Permission Profiles Management

It is a module that allows you to manage access permissions for different types of users.
There are 5 default Permission Profiles:
-   **Administrator**: It is the System administrator. It has full access to everything.
-   **Publisher**: This person is the content administrator of the platform. It has access to all the modules except the "Management" menu. (Including Admin users, Permission Profiles editing and Roles editing).
-   **Ingestor**: People that only can have restricted access to manage the multimedia content in the back office. It does not have access to the "Management" menu (as before), it cannot access the tags and series types Tables. It cannot change the multimedia object status. It can only upload videos through the Wizard or through the OC-Importer.
-   **Autopublisher**: They are people that can manage only their own multimedia content. It has the same restrictions as the "Ingestor". It cannot access the "Live" menu (live channels and events). It cannot access the OC-Importer. It only has access to the series and multimedia objects he creates. ("Owner" role. Check Section 2.3.1 for more details). It cannot access the Galicaster FM, the Server Panel or Opencast.

### 2.2.2 Types of Scope

There are three types of scope: Global, Personal and None:

##### 2.2.2.1 Global Scope

Users with a global scope have access to the series and multimedia objects of all users. A user with global scope can delete any multimedia object or series.

##### 2.2.2.2 Personal Scope

Personal scope users only have access to the series and multimedia objects they have created. If you remove yourself from the „Owner" Role of a multimedia object, you will no longer have access to it. A user with personal scope can add other users to a series or Multimedia Object (in People, role owner. See section 2.3.1 The Owner Role).

A user with personal scope cannot delete other users from multimedia object or series, except for himself (in People, role owner).

A user can only delete a multimedia object or series if there are no other users as owners of the multimedia object. (See Section 2.3.1-The Owner Role). In the case of the series, the user can only delete it if all multimedia objects within the series belong to him and none of them belong to other users.

##### 2.2.2.1 No Scope

A user with No Scope only has access to the video portal.

### 2.2.3 Permissions explained

## 2.3 Roles tool

Roles are the criteria through which People are linked to a multimedia object. People can be linked as an "Actor", "Author", "Producer" or similar other titles that indicates his role on the making of that multimedia object's media.

That information (people and their roles on the multimedia object's making) can be displayed later on the Video Portal. If the "display" attribute of the role is checked, people with that Role will appear in the Video Portal for that multimedia object.

![](images/roles_list.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 13. Roles module</font></div>

### 2.3.1 The Owner Role

One example of a Role that is not displayed on the Video Portal is the "Owner" role. This is an especial Role used to determine which PuMuKIT users have ownership of a certain multimedia object. When a user creates a Multimedia Object, the Person linked to that user is added as "Owner". The ownership of a multimedia object determines whether certain types of users can access a video. The ownership of a multimedia object can be edited, and also other people can be later added as "Owner", thus giving access to several people to a multimedia object. (For more details on who can access which videos, check Section 2.2. Permission Profiles).

![](images/owner_role.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 14. Owner Role</font></div>

# 3 Other management modules

PuMuKIT's Back-office also has other modules to perform less common management tasks. In this section, the different admin existing modules will be summarized.

## 3.1 Encoder jobs module

It is a display that summarizes transcoding jobs: those in progress, those pending for transcoding, those that errored and those that were finished successfully.
